   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nThere was a moment we said our goodbyes\nI sat and wiped the tears from your eyes, yeah\nWe said we needed space to turn and walk away\nBut you know how to make me come back\nSo my darling dreamer, I'll see you tonight\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nI'm running through the nightmares you put in my head\nEvery time that I wake up, I'm in your bed\n\n[Chorus]\nLock these chains, throw away the key\nTried to stay away, but you grab a hold of me\nShe said \"Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking\"\nYou, you pull me under, drowning in the deep\nGotta stay awake, I don't wanna go to sleep\nBut she said \"Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking, sleepwalker\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nHaunted by secrets, my lips are sealed\nAll of your demons, it turns out they're real\nThe shadows on the wall, watch me as I crawl\nBut you know how to make me come back\nI'm just a monster that you'll never fear\n\n[Chorus]\nLock these chains, throw away the key\nTried to stay away, but you grab a hold of me\nShe said \"Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking\"\nYou, you pull me under, drowning in the deep\nGotta stay awake, I don't wanna go to sleep\nBut she said \"Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking, sleepwalker\"\n\n[Bridge]\nWhy won't you ever let me leave?\nWhy won't you ever let me leave?\nJust fucking let me out\nEvery time that I'm out of reach\nShe says \"Turn around\"\n\n[Chorus]\nLock these chains, throw away the key\nTried to stay away, but you grab a hold of me\nShe said \"Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking\"\nYou, you pull me under, drowning in the deep\nGotta stay awake, I don't wanna go to sleep\nBut she said \"Keep walking, sleepwalker, keep walking, sleepwalker\""
